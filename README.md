For bracket generation and scoring in .csv files

Gameday.ipynb is the file to generate 15,015 brackets from the 15 formulas specified.
Bracket Scoring.ipynb is the file to score them (as you update config/results to match the tournament).

The main audience of this project is just me, so you may have to redirect some folders in the files, and they are not well organized. Thanks, Gig'em, and God bless :)
